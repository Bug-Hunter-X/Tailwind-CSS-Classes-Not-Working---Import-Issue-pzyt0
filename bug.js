//In your main app.js file, you have included Tailwind directives like so:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

//But the compiled CSS file isn't being included in the HTML, or another CSS file isn't properly linked:
//In your HTML, make sure that you are including the compiled CSS file generated by Tailwind (often named output.css or similar):
<link rel="stylesheet" href="output.css">
